# 🗺️ Roadmap (Upcoming)

- [x] Backend API Development (TDD)

- [x] Database Seeding & Security

- [ ] **Frontend Implementation (React)** (In Progress 🚧)

- [ ] **Cloud Deployment (AWS/Vercel)** (Pending)

# 👋 A Note to the Reviewer 
First and foremost, **Thank You** for taking the time to review my repository! I truly appreciate the effort involved in evaluating my code. 🙏 
### 🚧 Regarding the Frontend & Deployment 
You may notice that the **Frontend (UI)** is currently missing from this repository. Due to strict time constraints and my commitment to following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and clean architecture principles for the Backend, I was unable to polish the Frontend to a standard I am proud of in time for this submission. 

**Current Status:** 
* 💻 The Frontend is currently under **active development**. 
*  ☁️ Once completed, the entire full-stack system will be deployed to the cloud. 

**My Humble Request:** 
I kindly ask that you evaluate my technical proficiency based on the **Backend architecture, API security, and Test Coverage** provided here. I hope you might grant some flexibility regarding the timeline for the UI, and I would be grateful if the missing frontend is not the sole reason for disqualification. I am working hard to finish the complete picture and would love the opportunity to show it to you soon! 🚀 
**Best Regards,** Pankaj Kumar

# Sweet Shop Management System

This is the backend application for managing a sweet shop inventory, user purchases, and administrative operations. This project is built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles and modern backend best practices.

## Project Overview
This system allows users to browse sweets, search by category/price, and purchase items using a secure payment flow (Razorpay integration). Administrators have escalated privileges to manage inventory, add new products with images (Cloudinary integration), and restock supplies.

## Tech Stack
**Backend:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (Atlas for Prod, In-Memory for Test)
- **ODM:** Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Upload:** Multer & Cloudinary
- **Payments:** Razorpay
- **Testing:** Jest & Supertest

## Backend Documentation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas Account (or local MongoDB)
- Cloudinary Account
- Razorpay Account

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd sweet-shop-management
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set Environment Variables**
	Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following keys:
	```env
	PORT=5000
	MONGO_URI = your_mongodb_connection_string
	
	JWT_SECRET = your_secure_jwt_secret
	
	CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your_cloud_name
	CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your_api_key
	CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = your_api_secret
	
	RAZORPAY_KEY_ID = your_razorpay_key_id
	RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET = your_razorpay_key_secret
	
	ADMIN_FULLNAME =
	ADMIN_USERNAME = 
	ADMIN_EMAIL = 
	ADMIN_PASSWORD =
	```
5.  **Run the Server**
    ```bash
    # Development Mode (uses nodemon)
    npm run dev

    # Production Mode
    npm start
    ```

### API Endpoints
1. **User Authentication  APIs**

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/users/register` | Register a new user | No |
| POST | `/api/v1/users/login` | Login (Returns JWT) | No |
| POST | `/api/v1/users/logout` | Logout (Blacklists Token) | Yes |

2. **Sweets APIs**

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/sweets` | View all sweets (Search / Filter) | No |
| POST | `/api/v1/sweets` | Add new sweet (with Image Upload) | Admin |
| POST | `/api/v1/sweets/:id/purchase` | Purchase a sweet | Yes |
| POST | `/api/v1/sweets/:id/restock` | Restock inventory | Admin |

### Tests Report
This project strictly follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

### Running Tests

```bash
#Run all tests(unit & Integration)
npm test
```
**Note**: Tests use `mongodb-memory-server` for isolation and do not affect the production database.

## My AI Usage
**Mandatory Disclosure as per Project Requirements**

I used AI tools (specifically **Gemini**) as a co-author and technical thought partner throughout the development lifecycle. Below is a detailed breakdown of how AI was leveraged:

-   **Gemini (Google):** Used for generating boilerplate code, writing complex test cases, and debugging errors.

-   **TDD Workflow:** I used Gemini to generate the initial "Red" phase test suites using Jest and Supertest. This ensured comprehensive coverage for edge cases before I wrote any implementation code.
    
-   **Mocking External Services:** Gemini assisted in creating Jest mocks for **Cloudinary** and **Razorpay**. This allowed me to test file uploads and payment flows without making actual network requests or needing valid API keys during testing.
    
-   **Refactoring:** I used AI to refactor the User Controller. For example, moving the JWT generation logic from the controller into a Mongoose instance method (`user.generateAuthToken`) to follow "Fat Model, Thin Controller" principles.
    
-   **Debugging:** When I encountered a `ReferenceError` caused by a copy-paste issue (`cite_start`), I pasted the error log into Gemini, which identified the syntax error immediately.
    

 **Reflection on AI Impact**

AI significantly accelerated the development process, particularly in setting up the testing infrastructure. It handled the repetitive task of writing boilerplate test code, allowing me to focus on the business logic. However, manual oversight was crucial. For instance, I had to manually correct environment variable mismatches in the test scripts (`JWT_SECRET` vs `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`) and fix named export issues that the AI initially got wrong. The collaboration resulted in a more robust and well-tested application than I might have built alone in the same timeframe.
